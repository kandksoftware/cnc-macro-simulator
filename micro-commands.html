          If you are using a micro command, the TOOL micro-command is mandatory before using another micro-command. The
          only exception is the SET micro-command.
        </div>
        <div class="message message--alert">
          <h3 class="message__header">Important</h3>
          Remember to define the tool radius in the CNC Macro Simulator II tool magazine before calling TOOL micro
          command.
        </div>
        <div class="article__content">
          Micro-commands are part of the synthetic sugar for ISO (RS-274) containing special keywords that describe
          cycles and special functions that are not normally available in G-code.
          Their use greatly simplifies programming and allows to minimize the amount of repetitive code.
        </div>
        <div class="article__content">
          Currently, they include keywords such as:
        </div>
        <div class="code-view this">
          SET
          BSHAPE
          ESHAPE
          TOOL
          SETTOOL
          DELTOOL
          CYCLE
          PATTERN
          POCKET
          SLOT
          SURFACE
          SHOULDER
          THREADING
          DRILLING
          BORING
          MIRROR
          SHIFT
          ZOOM
          ROTATE
        </div>
        <div class="article__content">
          You can also use micro-commands alternating with regular code or with macros to automate various types of
          tasks.
        </div>
        <div class="message message--info">
          <h3 class="message__header">Good to know</h3>
          The micro-commands are not part of the ISO standard and therefore must be converted by CNC Macro Simulator II
          to
          the proper code, understandable for CNC machines, which is done during code export.
        </div>
        <div class="article__content">
          To see how useful micro-commands are, let's see some common examples.
          As you know, in order to start performing any task on a CNC machine, you need to insert data about the tool,
          approach points, height correction, etc.What usually looks like this:
        </div>
        <div class="code-view">
          T1 M6
          G00 G54 X0. Y0.
          S1200 M3
          G43 H1 Z50. M8
        </div>
        <div class="article__content">
          Just look, 4 lines of boilerplate code that repeats almost all the time, with most of the only difference
          being the tool number and the approach point. Additionally, remember not to forget to insert the decimal
          point!Looks like a huge waste of time, right? Of course, you can try to copy and paste, but you still need to
          change some data and so on. And here you can see how useful microcommands are.Instead of writing the same
          piece of code over and over again, you can use:
        </div>
        <div class="code-view">
          TOOL 1 S1200
        </div>
        <div class="article__content">
          Amazing, isn't it? This micro-command produces the same code snippet as the output as in the example above.
          But what if you want to change some data? How to do it?It's simple, take a look:
        </div>
        <div class="code-view">
          TOOL 1 S1200 X100
        </div>
        <div class="article__content">
          Is equal to:
        </div>
        <div class="code-view">
          T1 M6
          G00 G54 X100. Y0.
          S1200 M3
          G43 H1 Z50. M8
        </div>
        <div class="article__content">
          Next one:
        </div>
        <div class="code-view">
          TOOL 1 S1200 C0 (COOLANT OFF)
        </div>
        <div class="article__content">
          Is equal to:
        </div>
        <div class="code-view">
          T1 M6
          G00 G54 X0. Y0.
          S1200 M3
          G43 H1 Z50. M9
        </div>
        <div class="article__content">
          As you may have noticed, the name of the address in most cases corresponds to the first letter of a full
          English term, which makes it much easier to use.

          <br /><br />Let's see another, more extensive example. Mostly in real life, you will have to invoke the tool
          multiple times and some data changes but others stay the same, such as the approach point.
          In this case, it is very useful to use the SET keyword to override the default values of other micro-commands.

        </div>
        <div class="code-view">
          SET X20 Y35 Z3
          TOOL 1 S500
          …
          TOOL 2 S1200
          …
          TOOL 3 S250
        </div>
        <div class="article__content">
          Is equal to:
        </div>
        <div class="code-view">
          T1 M6
          G00 G54 X20. Y35.
          S500 M3
          G43 H1 Z3. M8
          …
          T2 M6
          G00 G54 X20. Y35.
          S1200 M3
          G43 H2 Z3. M8
          …
          T3 M6
          G00 G54 X20. Y35.
          S250 M3
          G43 H3 Z3. M8
        </div>
        <div class="article__content">
          You are probably already able to notice how micro-commands make the work easier.
          Well, it's time for a real example of the program!
          <br /><br />In this diagram there are 10 COARSE M10 X 1.5 threads at a 13 degree angle. Of course, holes must
          be drilled before tapping and chamfered.

        <div class="article__content">
          Here's what a finished program looks like using micro commands for this example
        </div>
        <div class="code-view">
          O0001
          SET A13
          #100 = 3 (LINES)
          #101 = 4 (COLUMNS)
          (DRILLING)
          TOOL 1 S3067
          CYCLE Z-23.981 F613
          PATTERN 4 L#100 C#101
          (CHAMFERING)
          TOOL 2 S523
          CYCLE Z-2.25 F107

        </div>
        <div class="article__content">
          And as it looked, without using micro commands.
          Of course, you can use a subroutine for coordinates, but the code is less readable anyway and requires more
          focus when changing any of the contained data.
