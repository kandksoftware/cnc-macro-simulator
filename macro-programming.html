          CNC macro programming (also called CNC parametric programming) is a valuable tool in the CNC (Computer Numeric
          Control) field because it allows the automation of complex and repetitive tasks. By creating a macro, CNC
          operators can streamline their work and reduce the chance of errors.

        <ul class="list list--full list--nice">
          <li>
            customization: parametric programming allows CNC operators to customize their machining programs by
            defining variables that can be adjusted as needed. This allows operators to quickly and easily make changes
            to their programs, which can be particularly useful when producing a batch of parts with slight variations
          </li>
          <li>
            efficiency: by using CNC macro programming, CNC operators can streamline their machining processes and
            improve efficiency. For example, they can use parametric programming to automatically adjust machining
            parameters based on the specific requirements of the part being produced
          </li>
          <li>
            quality: the use of parametric programming can improve the quality of the parts being produced by ensuring
            that they are consistently machined according to the specified instructions. This can reduce the risk of
            defects and improve the overall precision of the parts
          </li>
          <li>
            versatility: CNC macro programming allows CNC operators to adapt their machining programs to a wide range
            of different parts and materials. This can be particularly useful for companies that produce a wide variety
            of different parts, as it allows them to use a single machining program for multiple applications
          </li>
          <li>speed: CNC macros can be faster to execute than CAM programs, as they do not require the overhead of
            running a complex software package. This can be particularly useful for companies that need to produce parts
            quickly and efficiently
          </li>
          <li>
            less code - using macro programming allows you to use less code, which makes your program more portable
            and can also be used on CNC machines with low memory capacity
          </li>
