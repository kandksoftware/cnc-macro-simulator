          use it, you can paste your code, open a file, use one of the examples or simply write a cnc program yourself.
          In this case, we will use one of the built-in code examples.

        <p class="article__content">As you can see in the attached picture, the code is automatically colored and
          formatted to increase the readability of the information it contains.

        <img class="article__img" src="resources/menu-run.png" alt="menu run" />
        <p class="article__content">To execute the code, press the triangular button in the upper right corner. See the
          picture above.</p>
        <img class="article__img" src="resources/code-error.png" alt="code error" />
        <p class="article__content">In the screenshot above, you can see what happens after the code is executed. As you
          can see, a lot of bugs have emerged. This is due to the fact that the example program used does not have such
          information about the tool used and other important information, without which the tool can hit the milling
          table or the workpiece.
          But if you are writing code only for learning macros or writing a subroutine and therefore your code does not
          contain information such as the tool number or other information that is usually entered at the beginning of
          the main program, you can disable AERS by using the switch in the settings (see image below).
        </p>

        <p class="article__content">As you can see now, the program ran without any error messages. However, remember to
          always use AERS turned on, your program is to be used in practice.
