        <h1 class="faq__title">FAQ</h1>
        <div class="separator"></div>
        <h2 class="faq__question">Whether the purchase is indefinite or has a validity period.</h2>
        <p class="faq__answer">The purchase is for an unlimited period of time and has no expiry date.</p>
        <h2 class="faq__question">I cannot find the file after saving it.</h2>
        <p class="faq__answer">For most devices (desktops and mobile devices) files will be saved to the download
          folder, unless you changed the default directory</p>
        <h2 class="faq__question">The message "Program not found" appears.</h2>
        <p class="faq__answer">You are probably using the wrong settings - for example: if you want to create a program
          for a Haas machine, select the Haas option in the settings panel. If it does not work, please contact us.</p>

        <h2 class="faq__question">I found an error, what should I do?</h2>
        <p class="faq__answer">If you found any bug, please contact us.</p>
        <h2 class="faq__question">After pressing the execution button (light gray triangle in the upper right corner of
          the top bar) "Execution in progress" state does not change.</h2>
        <p class="faq__answer">This could be because your program is very long, has many loops, or has many nested
          loops. In this case, wait for a while for the program to complete. However, if the execution time is more than
          30 seconds, it may mean a looping of the program. To finish its execution, press the red stop button. If you
          cannot find the wrong part in your code, go to "Exec line / Line by line‚Äù and press "Play" or " Play fast".
          After a while you should recognize what part of the code is repeating itself. If you are still unsure, press
          "Stop" and then manually step through the lines using the "Next" button.</p>
        <h2 class="faq__question">There were some warnings during the execution of the program, can I still use this
          program?</h2>
        <p class="faq__answer">Yes, warnings do not mean that your program is buggy, but rather are intended to draw
          attention to possible unclear situations that may consequently be dangerous.</p>
        <h2 class="faq__question">The rendered image is so large that I cannot shift it to see all the details. What
          should I do?</h2>
        <p class="faq__answer">In the "Settings" panel, change the table settings to the size that matches the size of
          your CNC milling machine or CNC machining center.</p>
        <h2 class="faq__question">How to use external subroutines?</h2>
        <p class="faq__answer">Since you have a different file structure on your mobile device and this can cause
          problems with finding the subroutine, subroutines are added after the main program, just like local
          subroutines.</p>
        <h2 class="faq__question">I'm using a Fanuc control that is not listed in compatibility. Will it work?</h2>
        <p class="faq__answer">In most cases, the differences in Fanuc when it comes to programming are minor, so there
          should not be any problem. Nevertheless, it is better to check the manual.</p>
